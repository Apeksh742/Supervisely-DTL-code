## ðŸ¤– [What's Supervisely](https://supervise.ly/)
Supervisely is a powerful platform for computer vision development, where individual researchers and large teams can annotate and experiment with datasets and neural networks.

## [What is DTL](https://docs.supervise.ly/data-manipulation/index)
Data preparation for training takes most of data scientists's time. In addition, there is a high probability of mistakes while performing such process. So DTL is a special language that allows to fully automate data manipulation: merge projects and datasets, make classes mapping, various augmentations of images and annotations, save to different formats and more.

Other details such as how to create them, run them, and use them can be found [here](https://docs.supervise.ly/data-manipulation/index)
